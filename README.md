# What is FEIO?
FEIO (Fitness Evaluation Is Overrated) is a C# implementation of Priority-Based Fitness Evaluation (PBFE), a genetic technique
that reduces fitness evaluations using a heuristic approach.

# How does FEIO work?
FEIO predicts which individuals are more likely to have an "unexpected" fitness and evaluates them, while using the average of the parents' fitness as an estimate.
